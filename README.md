# Student Management System (Console Based)

A menu-driven console application developed in Core Java as part of the WeIntern Week 1 Task.  
This project demonstrates a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, CRUD operations, and data handling using ArrayList.


## Features

- Add new student records  
- View all students  
- Update existing student details  
- Delete student records  
- Simple and user-friendly console interface
- Persistent storage using file handling (student records are saved and loaded automatically between executions)


## Concepts Implemented

- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)  
- CRUD Operations  
- Java Collections Framework (ArrayList)  
- Menu-driven program design  
- User input handling using Scanner
- File Handling for persistent data storage


## Tech Stack

| Technology | Usage |
|-----------|------|
| Java | Core application development |
| OOP | Data modeling and business logic |
| ArrayList | In-memory data storage |
| File I/O | Persistent storage of student records |
| VS Code | Development environment |
